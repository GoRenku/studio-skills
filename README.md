# Renku

Renku is a Codex and Claude Code plugin library for movie-making workflows.

This repo is meant to grow into a collection of filmmaking skills for writing, development, pre-production, production planning, and related creative workflows.

The included skills cover screenplay drafting and Visual Language Inspiration analysis.

## Included Skills

### Screenplay Drafter

```text
skills/screenplay-drafter/
  SKILL.md
  agents/openai.yaml
  references/screenplay-yaml-schema.md
```

Screenplay Drafter helps writers move from a rough story idea to:

- Project metadata, logline, summary, dramatic question, and themes
- A story arc with acts and key inflection points
- Cast folders with front-matter Markdown for names, roles, wants, needs, voice notes, arcs, and long descriptions
- Location folders with front-matter Markdown for names, time periods, descriptions, and visual notes
- Act YAML files made from scene settings and renderer-friendly blocks: action with optional `@id` mentions, dialogue with `cast_id`, voiceover, montage headings, title cards, supers, transitions, and notes

The output is a small screenplay package so a later renderer can turn it into a traditional screenplay document.

Invoke it in Codex with:

```text
$screenplay-drafter
```

Example prompt:

```text
$screenplay-drafter help me create a 5-minute family fantasy short about a child who discovers an abandoned mountain tunnel connected to a forgotten railway.
```

### Inspiration Analyzer

```text
skills/inspiration-analyzer/
  SKILL.md
  agents/openai.yaml
  references/inspiration-analysis-cli-workflow.md
  references/inspiration-analysis-json-contract.md
  references/cinematography-analysis-guidelines.md
  samples/analysis.json
```

Inspiration Analyzer helps agents analyze a Renku Studio Visual Language
Inspiration folder from the user's stored image files.

It uses:

- the Renku CLI to open the project, find the Inspiration folder, validate the
  analysis JSON, and persist it;
- the folder name as a hint when it appears to name a movie, director,
  cinematographer, photographer, painter, period, location, or visual movement;
- normal filesystem commands to inspect the image files inside the folder;
- a schema-validated `kind: "inspirationAnalysis"` JSON document.

Invoke it in Codex with:

```text
$inspiration-analyzer
```

Example prompt:

```text
$inspiration-analyzer analyze the Blade Runner 2049 Inspiration folder in my current Renku project.
```

## Install In Codex

For local development, add this repository as a Codex plugin marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add GoRenku/renku --ref main
```

Then open Codex's plugin directory and install `renku` from the `Renku` marketplace.

## Install In Claude Code

From Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add GoRenku/renku
/plugin install renku@renku
/reload-plugins
```

Then ask Claude Code to use the relevant Renku skill, such as Screenplay Drafter.
